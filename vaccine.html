                <h2> Information about vaccine that is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a COVID-19 infectious disease.</h2>
                <p><img src="img/p6.png" alt="cause" class="right">The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses. Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. 
                    In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.<br><br></p>
                    <h1><u>Is there any vaccine for coronavirus?</u></h1>
                    <p>Yes. There are three COVID-19 vaccines for which certain national regulatory authorities have authorized the use. None have yet received WHO EUL/PQ authorization but we expect an assessment on the Pfizer vaccine by the end of December and for some other candidates soon thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Large studies of 5 vaccine candidates efficacy and safety results, including these three (and for Moderna and AstraZeneca), have been publicly reported through press releases but only one (AstraZeneca) has published results in the peer reviewed literature. We expect more such reports in the near future. It is likely that additional candidates will be submitted to regulatory authorities for approval.
                         There aremany potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in development.</p>
                    <p>Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be approved by national regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process, including to facilitate equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need them.
                    </p>

                    <h1><u><img src="img/p8.png" alt="cause" class="left">When will covid-19 vaccine be distributed?</u></h1>
                    <p>The first COVID-19 vaccines are beginning to be introduced in countries. Before COVID-19 vaccines can be delivered:</p>
                    <li>The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III) clinical trials. Some large clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates have reported encouraging preliminary results, and many other potential vaccines are being developed.</li><br>
                    <li>A series of independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine product for prequalification. Part of this process also involves the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.</li><br>
                    <li>In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.</li><br>
                    <li>An external panel of experts convened by WHO, called the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), analyzes the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, and other information. The panel then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used.</li><br>
                    <li>Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.</li><br>
                    <li>The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a major and unprecedented challenge all the while continuing to produce all the other important life-saving vaccines already in use.</li><br>
                    <li>As a final step, all approved vaccines will require distribution through a complex logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature control.</li>
                     <br><br><br><br>
                    <h1><u>Will covid-19 vaccine provide long term protection?</u></h1>
                    <p>It is too early to know if COVID-19 vaccines will provide long-term protection. Additional research is needed to answer this question. However, it is encouraging that available data suggest that most people who recover from COVID-19 develop an immune response that provides at least some period of protection against reinfection although we are still learning how strong this protection is, and how long it lasts.</p>
                    <p>Most COVID-19 vaccines being tested or reviewed now are using two dose regimens.</p><br>

                    <h1><u><img src="img/p7.png" alt="cause" class="right">India Covid-19 vaccination FAQs</u></h1>
                    <p>The national drug regulator on Sunday gave emergency restricted approval fortwo vaccine candidates,Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, a version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured under licence by Serum Institute of India.
                        As the country took the final step to begin vaccinating priority groups against the novelcoronavirus, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, who has been at the forefront of the government management of the Covid-19 pandemic, released a video on the vaccination.</p>
                        <h2>Who gets the Covid-19 vaccine first, and how?</h2>
                        <p>Priority groups such as healthcare workers, frontline workers are first on the list, followed by people over the age of 50 years and the persons under 50 years with co-morbid conditions.
                            The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through the registered mobile numbers regarding the health facility where the vaccine will be provided, and the health schedule.</p>
                        <h2>Will it be mandatory to take the vaccine?</h2>
                        <p>The vaccine will be voluntarily. However, it is advisable to complete the vaccine schedule in order to protect ourselves, our near and dear ones, our close contacts, family members, and co-workers.</p>
