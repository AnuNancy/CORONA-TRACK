                <h2> Feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body.</h2>
                <h1><u><img src="img/p9.png" alt="cause" class="right">How should I wash fruits and vegetables in the time of covid-19?</u></h1>
                <p>Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.</p>
                <h2>Do the virus that causes covid-19 live on the surface of food packaging?</h2>
                <p>Coronaviruses need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive and cannot multiply on the surface of food packages. It is not necessary to disinfect food packaging materials, but hands should be properly washed after handling food packages and before eating.</p>
                <h2>Are vitamin-D supplements needed if individuals are not exposed to sunlight due to lockdowns?</h2>
                <p>Vitamin D can be made in the skin by exposure to sunlight or obtained through the diet from natural sources (e.g. fatty fishes such as salmon, tuna and mackerel, fish liver oils, beef liver, cheese and egg yolks), or from vitamin D-fortified foods or vitamin D-containing supplements.</p>
                <p>In situations where individual vitamin D status is already marginal or where foods rich in vitamin D (including vitamin D-fortified foods) are not consumed, and exposure to sunlight is limited, a vitamin D supplement in doses of the recommended nutrient intakes (200-600 IU, depending on age) or according to national guidelines may be considered.</p>
                <h2>Is it safe to have groceries delivered?</h2>
                <p>Yes, it is safe to have groceries delivered if the provider follows good personal and food hygiene practices. After accepting food/grocery deliveries, hands should be properly washed.</p>
                <h2>What is the best houshold disinfectant for surfaces?</h2>
                <p>Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.  For cleaning and disinfecting households with suspected or confirmed COVID19, surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on ethanol (at least 70%), should be used.</p>

                <h2>Eat a variety of foods:</h2>
                <p>Every day, eat a combination of different foods including whole grains such as wheat, maize and rice, legumes like lentils and beans, fruit and vegetables and some foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).</p>
                <h2>Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables:</h2>

                <h2>Eat moderate amounts of healthier fats and oils:</h2>
                <li>Replace butter, ghee and lard (saturated fats) with oils rich in healthier fats (unsaturated fats) like olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil when cooking.</li>
                <li>Choose white meats like poultry and fish which are generally lower in fats than red meat.</li>
                <li>Select low-fat milk and dairy products.</li>
                <li>Try steaming or boiling instead of frying food when cooking.</li>
                <br>

                <h2>Drink enough water and stay hydrated:</h2>
                <p>Good hydration is crucial for optimal health. Drinking enough plain water is a simple way to get hydrated as it has zero calories.</p>
                <h2>Avoid hazardous and harmful alcohol use:</h2>
                <p>Alcohol is not part of a healthy diet. Drinking alcohol does not protect against COVID-19 and can be dangerous. There is no safe level of alcohol consumption.
